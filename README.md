## Getting started


## Installation

You first need to install Node.js and MongoDB to run this project.

Once the project is cloned, run `npm install` to download the dependencies needed.

## Execution

There are 3 ways to start the server : 
* `npm run start` runs the project with `nodemon`
* `npm run start:server` runs the server normally
* `npm run start-gendoc` runs the server to generate the Swagger documentation

The server is then available at the address http://localhost:8080 and the Swagger documentation at the address http://localhost:8080/doc.
